Restless Bandit's UI task
=========================

Welcome! This is a small exercise designed to let you show us your design implementation skills.

## The task

We've decided to use a card-based layout for displaying some jobs in our product. Our designer has created a mockup of how this should look (`card-layout.png`).

Your task is to build the layout shown in the mockup using HTML/CSS.

**What we're looking for:**

* Accurate translation of the design
* Attention to detail
* Sensible naming conventions
* Clean, consistent code style

## Workflow

1. Create your project directory (it's fine to work from this one)
2. Initialize a Git repository (run `git init` from your project directory)
3. Work on the task, committing your work as you go (it's fine to commit directly to `master` for this task)
4. When you're done, bundle your repo: `git bundle create repo.bundle master`
5. Now you have a file named `repo.bundle`
6. Email it to `imogen@restlessbandit.com`

## Other info

* The font used is Source Sans Pro (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
* The images are located in `images/`

Good luck!


## Notes
√ Animated Hover Effects of icons
* Center cards in container
* Tooltips - telling users to click on icon to reorder cards
* Clicking on icons or bottom part of cards reorders cards based on that metric, e.g, clicking on applicants reorders cards from most applicants to least
√ Cards are draggable, i.e., users can drag cards to reorder them
* modals telling user cards are draggable and other noteworthy tips 
* Load app with basic template skeleton so user see image before all content is fully loaded
* accessible. tabbable content and screenreader accessible
* test in mobile!
* Why did you choose flexbox over grid - browser support, right?
